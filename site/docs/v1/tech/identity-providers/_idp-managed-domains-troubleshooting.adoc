A common pattern is to set up {idp_type_name} as the login method for the FusionAuth application. This lets you keep all your users in the {idp_type_name} system, and have FusionAuth delegate auth decisions to it. However, if your Identity Provider isn't configured correctly, you can end up in a dead end, unable to log in. This might happen if the following occurs:

* You set up {idp_type_name} as the authentication method for your FusionAuth admin application.
* You set the [field]#Managed domains# to your domain. For example, `example.com`.
* All added users have the same `example.com` domain.
* You accidentally misconfigure {idp_type_name} and break authentication.
* Then you log out of the FusionAuth administrative user interface.

You won't be able to log in to the FusionAuth admin application to correct the misconfiguration. You've locked down the FusionAuth admin application so that only users with `example.com` email domains can access it, but because of the misconfiguration, there is no account with a valid {idp_type_name} login.

This is a problem, but not an insurmountable one. Your options depend on when you discover the issue. If you are beginning your {idp_type_name} configuration, you can avoid this scenario. Follow these steps:

* Don't set any value of [field]#Managed domains# before you have tested the {idp_type_name} configuration. 
* Test authentication in a different or incognito browser window, ensuring that an admin user account is always accessible to modify configuration.
* Add an admin user account with a domain not in the [field]#Managed domains# setting. Ensure this user is registered with the FusionAuth admin application and has the `admin` role.
* Set up an API key. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys# to do so and make sure it has privileges to create users and registrations. This will open up options in the future to reset settings without using the administrative user interface.

If you are currently locked out of your FusionAuth application, you have fewer options:

* If you have a known username and password that are not delegated to {idp_type_name} (perhaps the initial account created when you set up FusionAuth) proceed to the FusionAuth admin login page. Append `&showPasswordField=true` to the end of the login URL. This will force the UI to show the password field. 
* If you have an API key with appropriate privileges, you can modify the configuration without using the administrative user interface. Add an admin user with a different email domain and sign into the admin interface to correct your {idp_type_name} configuration. Here's how you might do so (`3c219e58-ed0e-4b18-ad48-f4f92793ae32` is the FusionAuth application Id):

[source,shell]
.Adding a New Admin User With a Different Domain
----
curl -XPOST -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
	"user": {
		"email": "user@differentdomain.com",
		"password": "password"
	},
	"registration": {
		"applicationId": "3c219e58-ed0e-4b18-ad48-f4f92793ae32",
		"roles": ["admin"]
	}
}' \

If you have neither an API key nor a known user, you can restore from a database backup, modify the database directly if you have access, or re-install FusionAuth.
