== Overview

Integrations allow you to extend the feature set of FusionAuth by utilizing third party APIs. The following integrations are
currently available.

* link:/docs/v1/tech/integrations/cleanspeak[CleanSpeak]
* link:/docs/v1/tech/integrations/kafka[Kafka]
* link:/docs/v1/tech/integrations/twilio[Twilio]

Find the FusionAuth Integrations in the UI by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Integrations# or use the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/integrations[Integrations] APIs. Each available integration will show up in gray scale with the *[green-text]#Enable#* green text in the bottom right. To enable and configure and integration click on the tile and select `Enable`. Once enabled, the tile will show the color version of the tile and the text in the bottom right will read *[blue-text]#Configure#* in blue text.
