When creating an object with the FusionAuth API, you can specify the Id. It must be a link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types#uuids[UUID].

This works for users, applications, and tenants, among others.

If you have external dependencies on an Id stored in {migration_source_name}, port the same Id over to FusionAuth.
