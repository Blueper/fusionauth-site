.Common Proxy Error Message
----
Something doesn't seem right. You have been logged out of FusionAuth. If you were attempting to log in please click 'Return to Login' to retry.

If you are using FusionAuth Cloud, ensure that you have added the hostname of the proxy to which the initial request has been made to your list of custom domains.

For additional troubleshooting, it is helpful to remove any proxies one at a time and try to log in. This can help narrow down the source of the problem.
