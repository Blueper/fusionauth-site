title: Provision a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Kubernetes Cluster
description: Provision a GKE cluster in Google Cloud (GCP)
keywords: docker kubernetes k8s container aws
---

== Overview

This guide will show you how to set up a GKE cluster on Google Cloud Platform, commonly referred to as GCP. When completed, you will have a fully functional Kubernetes cluster ready to deploy FusionAuth to as well as a PostgreSQL database using GCP's Cloud SQL.
The following method uses the default settings when provisioning the GKE cluster with the required resources and services. It is recommended that you consult https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs[Google Kubernetes Engine] for full GKE documentation, including any custom changes needed for your situation.

== Requirements

* https://console.cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Platform] account with sufficient IAM permissions to create resources.
* `gcloud` - Command Line tool used to manage resources in Google Cloud. For installation instructions, see https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[Installing Cloud SDK].
+
include::/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kubernetes/_kubectl.adoc[]

== Architecture

The resulting GKE cluster will use a VPC-native cluster in the `us-west1` region of which consists of three availability zones (`us-west1-a`, `us-west1-b`, and `us-west1-c`). You will provision a Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance to satisfy installation requirements of FusionAuth.

GCP provides a number of configuration options designed to meet specific needs based on cluster availability and workload types. For this example, you will use the https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture[Standard mode of operation].

== Project Setup

Having installed the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[Cloud SDK], authorize `gcloud` to access GCP using your Google credentials:

[source,shell,title=Authorize gcloud]
----
$ gcloud auth login
----

Now create a new project used to organize all of your Google Cloud resources:

[source,shell,title=Create a project]
----
$ gcloud projects create fusionauth-gke-example \
  --name="FusionAuth GKE example"
----

You will want to set the newly created project as your default project. When you create resources and enable APIs, they will be assigned to your default project:

[source,shell,title=Set the default project]
----
$ gcloud config set project fusionauth-gke-example
----

[source,text,title=Output]
----
Create in progress for [https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/fusionauth-gke-example].
Waiting for [operations/cp.999999999156305912] to finish...done.
Enabling service [cloudapis.googleapis.com] on project [fusionauth-gke-example]...
----

=== Enable Billing

In order to proceed, you will need to enable and link billing for your project. To do this:

1. Navigate to the https://console.cloud.google.com/[GCP Console].
2. From the navigation menu, select **Billing**.
3. Verify that billing is enabled for your project. If it's not, follow the prompts to link a billing to your project.

=== Enable Required APIs

Enable the https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/rest[Kubernetes Engine API]. This will allow you to make a service request to the API to create your GKE cluster:

[source,shell,title=Enable Kubernetes Engine API]
----
$ gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
----

You will need to enable the https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api[Cloud SQL API] in order to create a PostgreSQL database. Run the following command to do this:

[source,shell,title=Enable Cloud SQL API]
----
$ gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com
----

In order for our GKE cluster to communicate with PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch on internal IP addresses, the https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-networking/getting-started[Service Networking API] must be enabled:

[source,shell,title=Enable Cloud SQL API]
----
$ gcloud services enable servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
    --project=fusionauth-gke-example
----

=== Configure Network

Allocate an IP address range for private communication on your VPC:

[source,shell,title=Create private IP address range]
----
$ gcloud compute addresses create fusionauth-private-range \
  --global \
  --purpose=VPC_PEERING \
  --addresses=192.168.0.0 \
  --prefix-length=16 \
  --description="Fusionauth private IP range for GKE and SQL" \
  --network=default
Created [https://www.google
----

In order for GKE to communicate with Cloud SQL and Elasticsearch over a private network you need to create a private connection from your VPC network to the underlying service producer network.

[source,shell,title=Create a private connection]
----
$ gcloud services vpc-peerings connect \
  --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
  --ranges=fusionauth-private-range \
  --network=default \
  --project=fusionauth-gke-example
----

== Create a GKE Cluster

With your project configured, billing enabled, and the Kubernetes Engine API enabled, you can proceed to create your GKE cluster.

To create a new cluster, execute the following.

[source,shell,title=Create GKE cluster]
----
$ gcloud container clusters create fusionauth-cluster \
  --num-nodes=1 \
  --region=us-west1 \
  --enable-ip-alias \
  --cluster-version=1.21.4-gke.2300 \
  --cluster-ipv4-cidr=10.44.0.0/14 \
  --services-ipv4-cidr=10.48.0.0/20
----

* `num-nodes` - The number of nodes to be created in each zone. In this example, you specify the region of which consists of three zones. Therefore you will have a total of `3` nodes.
* `region` - The region to create the cluster.
* `enable-ip-alias` - Indicates to create a https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/alias-ips[VPC-native cluster]. This greatly simplifies network connectivity when communicating with the database by making pod IP addresses natively routable within the cluster's VPC network.
* `cluster-version` - The Kubernetes version to use. [optional]
* `cluster-ipv4-cidr` - Used to create the subnet's secondary IP address range for Pods. [optional]
* `service-ip-range` - Used to create the subnet's secondary IP address range for Services. [optional]
+
For more information on the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create[create] command, see https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create[gcloud container clusters create] documentation.

=== Update Kubernetes Configuration

If link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create[the create operation] completed successfully, the last thing it will do is update your local `~/.kube` file. If that didn't happen for whatever reason, `gcloud` provides the following to update your configuration and set the newly created cluster as the active context. This will let you use `kubectl` to access your cluster.

[source,shell,title=Get and update Kubeconfig]
----
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials fusionauth-cluster
----

=== Verify Cluster Configuration

Execute the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/list[list] command to see GKE clusters that have been configured.

[source,shell,title=Get cluster information]
----
$ gcloud container clusters list

NAME                LOCATION  MASTER_VERSION   MASTER_IP     MACHINE_TYPE  NODE_VERSION     NUM_NODES  STATUS
fusionauth-cluster  us-west1  1.21.4-gke.2300  34.83.218.38  e2-medium     1.21.4-gke.2300  3          RUNNING
----

You now have a fully functional provisioned EKS cluster. For good measure, view the nodes that have been created.
Use `kubectl` to make requests to the Kubernetes API Server.

[source,shell,title=Get list of nodes running on the cluster]
----
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

----

Great! You have three nodes in a `READY` status. You can proceed to setting up a database.

== Create a Database

Create a SQL Cloud PostgreSQL instance required for FusionAuth installation.

[source,shell,title=Create Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance]
----
$ gcloud beta sql instances create fusionauth-test-db \
  --project=fusionauth-gke-example \
  --database-version=POSTGRES_12 \
  --tier=db-g1-small  \
  --region=us-west1 \
  --network=default \
  --no-assign-ip
----

* `project` - The Id of the shared VPC service.
* `database-version` - Database engine type and version. See FusionAuth supported databases link:../../../system-requirements/#database[here].
* `tier` - Machine type for a shared-core instance.
* `region` - The region to create the cluster.
* `network` - Network in the current project that the instance will be part of.
* `no-assign-ip` - Disables assignment of a public IP address.

=== Configure the Default User

Google cloud SQL requires that you execute the following to configure the `postgres` user.

[source,shell,title=Set admin user password]
----
$ gcloud sql users set-password postgres \
  --instance=fusionauth-test-db \
  --password=changeMeToSomethingMoreSecure
----

=== Verify Database Creation
