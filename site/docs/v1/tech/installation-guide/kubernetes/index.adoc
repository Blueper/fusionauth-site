The following set of guides are designed to help you get FusionAuth up and running in a Kubernetes cluster as quickly and easily as possible.
Step-by-step instructions are provided on how to setup all of the required infrastructure for your local development machine or favorite cloud provider.

** link:setup/minikube[Minikube Setup]
** link:setup/eks[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)]
** link:setup/gke[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)]
** link:setup/aks[Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)]

Each setup guide provides instructions on provisioning a Kubernetes cluster specific to the provider. Since FusionAuth, at minimum requires a database, instructions on creating a managed PostgreSQL database are also included.

If you already have your Kubernetes platform setup, the link:fusionauth-deployment[Deploy FusionAuth to Kubernetes] guide demonstrates how to configure and deploy FusionAuth to your cluster.

[NOTE.note]
====
While databases can be deployed in Kubernetes using https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/[Stateful Sets], using managed services such as https://aws.amazon.com/rds/[Amazon RDS] or https://cloud.google.com/sql[Google Cloud SQL] are the preferred option as maintenance tasks like scaling, backups, and patching are handled for you.
====

Instructions are also provided in each guide on how to setup Elasticsearch. Using Elasticsearch is optional and can be configured accordingly prior to deploying FusionAuth.
