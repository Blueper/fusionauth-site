=== Links Emailed to Users Don't Function As Expected


Users cannot verify their application registration or verify their email. The link or code does not work (it is expired or there is some other error).

====  Check the Email Template

Ensure you have selected the correct email template.

**For Email Verification**

If attempting to verify email addresses, ensure you have selected the appropriate template (`Email Verification` as opposed to `Registration Verification` in this instance)

==== Check External Identifier Timeouts

Ensure your external identifier timeouts are appropriate. Reasonable defaults are set, but they can be adjusted ([breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Advanced Tab -> External identifier durations#), with particular attention paid to `Email Verification` and `Registration Verification` durations.
